						<h2 class="text-smartdesign">Smart Design</h2>
						<p>For us, great architecture transcends style or trend. Our work—our passion for design—is inspired by our investment in the unique qualities of our clients and the distinctive character of their sites. We look to explore and express what makes each project unique in order to create works of architecture singularly suited to their purpose and location.</p>
						
						<p>In our design approach, we carefully respond to the program requirements, interests and values of our clients in concert with the ecology, culture and history of their sites. In all of our projects, we strive to bring:
						
						<ul>
							<li><span class="item">Unique, elegant design solutions</span></li>
							<li><span class="item">Health, wellbeing and quality of experience</span></li>
							<li><span class="item">Physical durability and cultural longevity</span></li>
							<li><span class="item">Respect for existing site ecology</span></li>
							<li><span class="item">Genuine sustainability <a href="pdf/Heliotrope_Sustainability.pdf">(read more)</a></span></li>
							<li><span class="item">Economic value</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Delivery of the above is only possible with strong technical ability, thorough documentation and strong collaborative relationships. Contractors are consistent in their praise of our documents – documents that result in fewer change orders and more predictable cost forecasting.</p>

						<h2 class="text-strongrelationships">Strong Relationships</h2>
						<p>We believe great design, at its heart, is about people. Bringing great design to the people and communities we work for is our ultimate goal. Our practice is inspired by the positive creative relationships we develop with our clients and colleagues. We endeavor to ensure the experience of working with us be satisfying and memorable. We remain flexible and communicative throughout the design process to ensure that our design solutions reflect the needs and desires of our clients.</p>
<p>To us, meaningful architecture is the product of the fruitful collaboration between multiple parties, therefore we cultivate strong working relationships with the designers, craftspeople, engineers and builders whose dedication to creating unique, inspiring spaces mirrors our own.</p>
<p>In our studio, the design process is fueled by directed but adventurous creative thinking. We provide a haven for the type of creative thought that leads to inspiring design. Our studio is a place for learning and growth, where each designer is a generalist, capable and excited to tackle all aspects of a project.</p>
